--Regular Expressions--

In computing, a regular expression, also referred to as "regex" or "regexp", provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of charactes. A regular epxression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.

#Really clever "wild card" expressions for matching and parsin strings

--Understanding Regular Expressions--

*Very powerful and quite cryptic
*Fun once you understand them
*Regular expressions are a language unto themselves
*A language of "marker characters" - programming with characters
*It is kind of an "old school" langauge - compact

--Regular Expression Quick Guide--

^ Mathces the beginning of a line
$ Matches the end of the line
. Mathces any character
\s Matches whitespace
\S Matches any non-whitespace character
* Repeats a character zero or more times
*? Repeats a character zero or more times (non-greedy)
* Repeats a character one or more times
+? Repeats a character one or more times (non-greedy)
[aeiou] Matches a single character in the listed set
[^XYZ] Matches a single character not in the listed set
[a-z0-9] The set of characters can include a range
( Indicates where string extracion is to start
) Indicates where string extraction is to end

--The Regular Expression Module--

*Before you can use regular expressions in your program, you must import the library using "import re"

*You can use re.search() to see if a string matches a regular expression, similar to using the find() method for strings

*You can use re.findall() to extract portions of a string that match your regular expression, similar to a combination of find() and slicing: var[5:10]

--Using re.search() like find()--

hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line find('From:') >= 0:
       print(line)

import re
hand = open('mbox.short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line find('From:') >= 0:
       print(line)


--Using re.search() like startswith()--

hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:') :#We done printing the lins finding the lines from 
       print(line) 

.................................

import re

hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^From:', line) :#start from the beginning of the line (^) and from at the begining(^) the difference betwen the first example is that we use a method in the string
       print(line)

#We fine-tine what is matched by adding special characters to the string
